Utility to apply the stamp generated by `PDF::Watermark::PDF` in `imgsrv` onto a born digital PDF.

Uses https://pdfbox.apache.org/.

`imgsrv-tools.ini` is a project file for the IntelliJ IDEA IDE; this was last used in 2016 so YMMV.

For compatibility with HTDL `rdist`, `.gitignore` includes the `target` directory to avoid all artifacts being pushed to production. The file `target/stamper-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` should still be committed.
