# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

=item _initialize

Initialize MBooks::Operation::EditColl.  Must call parent initialize.

sub _initialize
{
    my $self = shift;
    my $attr_ref = shift;

    my $C = $$attr_ref{'C'};
    my $act = $$attr_ref{'act'};
    $self->SUPER::_initialize($C, $act);
}



# ---------------------------------------------------------------------

=item execute_operation

Perform the database operations necessary for EditColl action
These are update operations on one or all of the following 3 fields:

UI name          cgi param       field name
Collection Name  cn              MColl_ID
Description      desc            collname
shared status    shrd            shared

NOTE: this operation is overloaded.  It handles action 'editst' to
change the shared status and action 'editc' to edit the description,
collection name and shared status.  When the action is editst we need
to preserve the collection name and description.  This could be done
by passing both on the URL but it makes a shorter URL to test for the
case in the code here.  pfarber Mon Jun 23 12:22:19 2008
