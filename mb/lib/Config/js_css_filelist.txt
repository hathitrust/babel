# Paths below to HathiTrust *shared* css and js, i.e. web files in
# /mdp-web MUST be coded //common-web/...  They are transformed by
# View::_render_template().

# If debug=local is set, //common-web/... is transformed to
# /mdp-web/... otherwise to /appname/common-web/...  This means that
# css and js will come from either the shared web repo mdp-web.git or
# from its submodule under /appname/vendors/common-web, whichever is
# more convienent for the developer.

# If, in local.conf, debug_uncompressed_css=1 and/or
# debug_uncompressed_js=1, then the paths that will load that begin
# with //common-web/ are affected according to the debug=local
# switch. If a switch in local.conf is NOT set, then the concatenated
# file will load from /appname/web.

# The concatenator script make-concat always draws the shared files to
# concatenate from /appname/web/common-web.  This means that changes
# to shared web files in /mdp-web must be committed, pushed and pulled
# into the common-web submodule to be seen in the concatenated-min
# files.  So that usually the last phase of development.

# NOTE: paths WITHIN shared web files like graphics/foo.gif MUST be
# relative and MUST be coded withthe dot-slash syntax
# './graphics/foo.gif so the concatenator can change the path to
# common-web/graphics. This means that when a shared web file is
# loaded from /mdp-web it will find its paths relative to itself but
# when it is concatenated into concatenated-min under /appname/web it
# will find its paths in common-web, i.e. relative to its new location
