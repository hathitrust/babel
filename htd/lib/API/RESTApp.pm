=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module acts as a base class for applications which implement a RESTful
interface.   When an HTTP request is received some dispatching logic in
L<L<REST::Application>> is invoked, calling different handlers based on what the
kind of HTTP request it was (i.e. GET, PUT, etc) and what resource it was
trying to access.  This module won't ensure that your API is RESTful but
hopefully it will aid in developing a REST API.

=head1 OVERVIEW

The following list describes the basic way this module is intended to be used.
It does not capture everything the module can do.

=over 8

=item 1. Subclass

Subclass L<REST::Application>, i.e. C<use base 'REST::Application'>.

=item 2. Overload C<setup()>

Overload the C<setup()> method and set up some resource hooks with the
C<resourceHooks()> method.  Hooks are mappings of the form: 
       
            REGEX => handler

where handler is either a method name, a code reference, an object which
supports a method with the same name as the HTTP method (or C<getResource> if
no such method), or a reference to an array of the form: C<[$objectRef,
"methodName"]> (C<$objectRef> can be a class name instead).

The regular expressions are applied, by default, to the path info of the HTTP
request.  Anything captured by parens in the regex will be passed into the
handler as arguments.

For example:

    qr{/parts/(\d+)$} => "getPartByNumber",

The above hook will call a method named C<getPartByNumber> on the current
object (i.e. $self, an instance of L<REST::Application>) if the path info of
the requested URI matches the above regular expression.  The first argument to
the method will be the part number, since that's the first element captured in
the regular expression.

=item 3. Write code.

Write the code for the handler specified above.  So here we'd define the
C<getPartByNumber> method.

=item 4. Create a handler/loader.

Create an Apache handler, for example: 

    use MyRESTApp;
    sub handler {
        my $r = shift;
        my $app = MyRESTApp->new(request => $r);
        $app->run();
    }

or a small CGI script with the following code:

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use MyRESTApp;
    MyRESTApp->new()->run();

In the second case, for a CGI script, you'll probably need to do something
special to get Apache to load up your script unless you give it a .cgi
extension.  It would be unRESTful to allow your script to have a .cgi
extension, so you should go the extra mile and configure Apache to run your
script without it.  For example, it'd be bad to have your users go to:

    http://www.foo.tld/parts.cgi/12345.html
    
=item 5. Call the C<run()> method.

When the C<run()> method is called the path info is extracted from the HTTP
request.  The regexes specified in step 2 are processed, in order, and if one
matches then the handler is called.  If the regex had paren. matching then the
matched elements are passed into the handler.  A handler is also passed a copy
of the L<REST::Application> object instance (except for the case when the
handler is a method on the L<REST::Application> object, in that case it'd be
redundant).  So, when writing a subroutine handler you'd do:

            sub rest_handler {
                my ($rest, @capturedArgs) = @_;
                ...
            }

=item 6. Return a representation of the resource.

The handler is processed and should return a string or a scalar reference to a
string.  Optionally the handler should set any header information via the
C<header()> method on instance object pased in.

=head1 CALLING ORDER

The L<REST::Application> base class provides a good number of methods, each of
which can be overloaded.  By default you only need to overload the C<setup()>
method but you may wish to overload others.  To help with this the following
outline is the calling order of the various methods in the base class.  You can
find detailed descriptions of each method in the METHODS section of this
document.

If a method is followed by the string NOOP then that means it does nothing by
default and it exists only to be overloaded.

        setup() - NOOP

        preRun() - NOOP

The only methods not called as part of the new() or run() methods are the
helper methods C<resetHeader()> and C<setRedirect()>, both of which call the
C<header()> and C<headerType()> methods.

For example, if you wanted to have your code branch on the entire URI of the
HTTP request rather than just the path info you'd merely overload
C<getMatchText()> to return the URI rather than the path info.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new(%args)

This method creates a new L<REST::Application> object and returns it.  The
arguments passed in via C<%args>, if any, are passed untouched to the
C<setup()> method.

=head2 query([$newCGI])

This accessor/mutator retrieves the current CGI query object or sets it if one
is passed in.

=head2 defaultQueryObject([$newCGI])

This method retrieves/sets the default query object.  This method is called if
C<query()> is called for the first time and no query object has been set yet.

=head2 resourceHooks([%hash])

This method is used to set the resource hooks.  A L<REST::Application> hook is
a regex to handler mapping.  The hooks are passed in as a hash (or a reference
to one) and the keys are treated as regular expressions while the values are
treated as handlers should B<PATH_INFO> match the regex that maps to that
handler.  

Handlers can be code references, methods on the current object, methods on
other objects, or class methods.  Also, handlers can be differ based on what
the B<REQUEST_METHOD> was (e.g. GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, etc).

The handler's types are as follows:

=over 8

=item string 

The handler is considered to be a method on the current L<REST::Application>
instance.

=item code ref

The code ref is considered to be the handler.

=item object ref

The object is considered to have a method the same name as the HTTP method.
That is, if the object is being called because of GET then C<GET()> is called,
if it is called because of a C<DELETE> then C<DELETE()> is called.
C<getResource()> method will be used if C<getRequestMethod()> returns
false.

=item array ref 

The array is expected to be two elements long, the first element is a class
name or object instance.  The 2nd element is a method name on that
class/instance.  IF the 2nd element is ommitted then the method name is assumed
to be the same as the B<REQUEST_METHOD>, e.g. C<GET()>, C<PUT()>, whatever.

=item hash ref

The current B<REQUEST_METHOD> is used as a key to the hash, the value should be
one the four above handler types.  In this way you can specify different
handlers for each of the request types.  The request method can also be
specified as '*', in which case that is used if a more specific match is not
found.

It is possible for the value of the handler to be another hash ref, rather than
one of the four above types.  In this case it is assumed content-negotion is
wanted.  The keys of this second hash are MIME types and the values are one of
the four above types.  For example:

    $self->resourceHooks(
        qr{/parts/(\d+)} => {
            GET => {
                'text/json' => 'get_json',
                'text/xml', => 'get_xml',
                'text/xml' => 'get_html',
                '*/*' => 'get_html',
            },
            '*' => sub { die "Bad Method!" },
        }
    );

=back

The return value of the handler is expected to be a string, which
L<REST::Application> will then send to the browser with the
C<sendRepresentation()> method.

If no argument is supplied to C<resourceHooks()> then the current set of hooks
is returned.  The returned hash referces is a tied IxHash, so the keys are kept
sorted.

=head2 loadResource([$path])

This method will take the value of B<PATH_INFO>, iterate through the path
regex's set in C<resourceHooks()> and if it finds a match call the associated
handler and return the handler's value, which should be a scalar.  If $path is
passed in then that is used instead of B<PATH_INFO>.

=head2 run()

This method calls C<loadResource()> with no arguments and then takes that
output and sends it to the remote client.  Headers are sent with
C<sendHeaders()> and the representation is sent with C<sendRepresentation()>.

If the environment variable B<REST_APP_RETURN_ONLY> is set then output isn't
sent to the client.  The return value of this method is the text output it
sends (or would've sent).

=head2 sendHeaders()

This method returns the headers as a string.

=head2 sendRepresentation($representation)

This method just returns C<$representation>.  It is provided soely for
overloading purposes.

=head2 headerType([$type])

This accessor/mutator controls the type of header to be returned.  This method
returns one of "header, redirect, or none."  If C<$type> is passed in then that
is used to set the header type. 

=head2 header([%args])

This accessor/mutator controls the header values sent.  If called without
arguments then it simply returns the current header values as a hash, where the
keys are the header fields and the values are the header field values.

If this method is called multiple times then the values of %args are additive.
So calling C<$self->header(-type => "text/html")> and C<$self->header(-foo =>
"bar")> results in both the content-type header being set and the "foo" header
being set.

=head2 resetHeader()

This header causes the current header values to be reset.  The previous values
are returned.

=head2 defaultResourceHandler()

This method is called by C<loadResource()> if no regex in C<resourceHooks()>
matches the current B<PATH_INFO>.  It returns undef by default, it exists for
overloading.

=head2 bestContentType(@types)

Given a list of MIME types this function returns the best matching type
considering the Accept header of the current request (as returned by
C<getAcceptHeader()>.

=head2 simpleContentNegotiation(@types)

Given a list of MIME types this function returns the same list sorted from best
match to least considering the Accept header as returned by
C<getAcceptHeader()>.

=head2 getContentPrefs()

Returns the list of MIME types in the Accept header form most preferred to
least preferred.  Quality weights are taken into account.

=head2 getAcceptHeader()

Returns the value of the Accept header as a single string.

=head2 scoreType($type, @accept_types)

Returns an integer, only good for sorting, for where C<$type> fits among the
C<@accept_types>.  This method takes wildcards into account.  So C<text/plain>
matches C<text/*>.  The integer returned is the position in C<@accept_types> of
the matching MIME type.  It assumped @accept_types is already sorted from best
to worst.

=head2 getLastMatchPath()

Returns the last path passed to C<checkMatch()> which successfully matched
against.  Unless you're overloading things in funny ways the value returned
will be the path that caused the current handler to be invoked.

=head2 getLastMatchPattern()

Similar to C<getLastMatchPath()> except this is the pattern that was applied to
the path.

=head2 getRequestMethod()

This method tries to be smart and allow tunneling of the other HTTP methods
over GET or PUT.  You can tunnel three ways with the higher up taking
precedence:

1) Pass an X-HTTP-Method header
2) Pass the 'http_method' query parameter
3) Pass a parameter via POST 

Only POST and GET, being the most common, can be used to tunnel.  In an attempt
to prevent people from being bad, GET can only be used to tunnel GET or HEAD.
POST can be used to tunnel anything.
