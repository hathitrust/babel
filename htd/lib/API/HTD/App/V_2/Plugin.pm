package API::HTD::App::V_2::Plugin;


=head1 NAME

API::HTD::App::V_2::Plugin;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of API::HTD::App which contains resource handlers
and associated support code to handle the Version 2 schemas for the
HathiTruse Data API.

*** This is currently a placeholder/example of version evolution ***

Subsequent versions will, in all likelyhood, be largely copies of this
code with minor emendations.  Obviously, code copying is not
desirable.  However, the thought is that the functional changes between
versions are general unpredictable.  Consequently it would be difficult to
create a class hierarchy that defined a base class that supported an
inheritance scheme general enough to anticipate any new function that
might come along such that a subclass could easily override base class
functionality to implement it.
