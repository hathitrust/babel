What is a trusted client and/or a locked IP address and when required?

TYPE 0 .. 3 are present in htd_authorization table.

TYPE K and U are not in htd_authorization and are inferred by presence
of userid in htd_authentication table which indicates a user
authentication by login.

GEOTRUSTED means we can use the stored address for geo IP testing.

KNOWN means the stored IP address matches a regular expression
therefore the request originated from an address from which we allow
access to restricted/extended data types.

client   type  IP stored is   IP match vs is       valid                  geotrusted        originates at known addr for restricted/extended?

htdc     K     IP param       never matches        YES always (by userid) YES               NO (not in htd_authorization, i.e. code=1)

prog     U     REMOTE_ADDR    never matches        YES(by access key)     NO(because it could proxy) NO
                   

To test for "open" access that allows PDUS/ICUS we test the stored IP
address if geotrusted or for codes that give access to IC (that
implies access to PDUS/ICUS under any circumstances).
