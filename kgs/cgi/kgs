=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program is the application to: 

(1) Provide Data API (htd) users with an oauth_consumer_key and
oauth_consumer_secret.  Data API users supply a name, organization and
valid email address to which we mail a confirmation link the
registrant can follow to receive and activate their
keys. [/kgs/request /kgs/register /kgs/confirm]

(2) Record the userid (REMOTE_USER) of Data API Client (htdc) users
auto-register them so that the Data API client has an access_key for
them based on their authentication credential.  The user is redirected
to the wayf if xes is not authenticated. [/kgs/authed]

So in the ht.htd_authentication table there are two colums:

email: the email addresses to which we mailed confirmation links for
key provision to developers.  These email addresses can be used to
update developers on changes to Data API versions.

userid: authentication credentials for Data API Client users.  Data
API changes are opaquee to client users.
