This is a hacked version of PDF::API3 with many unneeded modules
removed from the tree to speed compilation. I tried
PDF::API3::Compat::API2::Lite and found no difference in compile time.
I think the idea of that was to simplify the API rather than to
produce a lightweight process.  

The hacked version can build a PDF consisting of JPEG2000 and TIFF
images with PNG watermark overlays on each page.  It was edited to
change paths from: 

from:     use PDF::API3::Compat::API2::Resource::XObject::Image::PNG; 
to:   use PT::PDF::API3::Compat::API2::Resource::XObject::Image::PNG;

It also includes a Resource/XObject/Image/JPEG2000 implementation by
